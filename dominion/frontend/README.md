Dominion gives journalist and civic activists useful facts and data about land ownership in Africa. Accessible at https://dominion.investigate.africa

## Style Guidelines

This project will be primarily using [airbnb react](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) as our main style guides when implementing components.This is to create code consistency and readability.

## ðŸš€ Quick start: Dominion React Front End

Before we get started, we need to have our back-end application running/already deployed. So on a terminal, run the back-end project [dominion](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/tree/feature/dominion-setup/dominion) as a [HURUmap-apps](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/blob/master/README.md).

Once your back-end is running either local or on a server, run the following commands to get started.

`Note: You will need to update the config dev.js file with the right url for your api/back-end project`

## Development
