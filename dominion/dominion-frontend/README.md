# Dominion React Front End


## Development

Before we get started, we need to have our back-end application running/already deployed. So on a terminal, run the back-end project [dominion](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/tree/feature/dominion-setup/dominion) as a [HURUmap-apps](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/blob/master/README.md).

Once your back-end is running either local or on a server, run the following commands to get started.

`Note: You will need to update the config dev.js file with the right url for your api/back-end project`

```
cd dominion-frontend
yarn
yarn start
```
