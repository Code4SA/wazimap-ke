# Dominion

Dominion gives journalist and civic activists useful facts and data about land ownership in Africa. Accessible at https://dominion.investigate.africa

## ðŸš€ Quick start: Dominion React Front End

Before we get started, we need to have our back-end application running/already deployed. So on a terminal, run the back-end project [dominion](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/tree/feature/dominion-setup/dominion) as a [HURUmap-app](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/blob/master/README.md).

Once dominion back end is up and running either locally or on a server, run the following commands to get started.

`Note: You will need to update the config dev.js file with the right url for your api/back-end project`

## Development

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a dependancy. See [the documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to set it up on your machine.

Run the following command to get started

```
cd frontend
yarn
yarn start
```

## Style Guidelines

This project will be primarily using [airbnb react styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) as our main style guides. This is to create code consistency and readability.
